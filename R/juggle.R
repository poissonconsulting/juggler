#' Juggle JAGS model code
#' 
#' Juggles JAGS model code, i.e., 
#' takes code in the JAGS dialect of the BUGS language
#' and produces alternative models from model fragments.
#' The fragments which must be in the data and/or model block
#' can be used to change, remove or add nodes. Note jg_juggle 
#' has not been implemented for the extended BUGS language
#' but can be applied before code is extended.
#' 
#' jg_juggle currently requires that each node be defined on
#' a separate line of code. It takes advantage of the fact
#' that each node is unique. Thus to replace a node
#' all one has to do it specify the new line of code
#' for the node. To remove a node the syntax
#' node <- NULL is used. Any nodes that are in the fragment
#' but not the code under modification are added at the highest level
#' unless they are bracketed by one or more pairs of {}s in which
#' case the bracketing is copied as well. Constant nodes that are rendered
#' childless by this process are automatically removed.
#'  
#' By default the JAGS model code specified by x is modified 
#' independently by each of the code fragments in ... to produce
#' nargs() - 1 strings of complete JAGS model code. If however
#' combine = TRUE then x is modified by all combinations of the code
#' fragments.  
#'   
#' @param x string of JAGS model code
#' @param ... other arguments
#' @param combine flag indicating whether to combine models
#' @return Strings of model code in JAGS dialect of BUGS language
#' or FALSE if fails (in which case also gives a warning).
